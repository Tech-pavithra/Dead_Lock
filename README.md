Rescue Ready: A Comprehensive Platform for Disaster Preparedness and Response

Overview:
Rescue Ready is a dedicated website designed to help users protect themselves and others from natural disasters. By signing up or logging in, users gain access to a wealth of resources and important insights on various natural calamities, including landslides, sandstorms, floods, earthquakes, and more. The platform offers several key features to enhance user experience and community support.

Key Features:

Informative Articles:

Users can access a rich collection of articles that provide essential information and safety tips related to natural disasters such as landslides, sandstorms, floods, and earthquakes. These articles are designed to equip users with the knowledge they need to stay safe and make informed decisions during emergencies.
Volunteer Sign-Up and Display:

Individuals willing to volunteer can sign up through the platform, specifying their preferred location for service. The list of registered volunteers is accessible to all visitors, making it easy for those in need to find available assistance in their area. Users can also filter volunteers by location, ensuring that help is directed where it is most needed.
Donation Form:

Users interested in donating essential items to victims of natural disasters can do so through the Donation Form. This feature allows donors to specify multiple materials they wish to contribute, ensuring that those affected by calamities receive the necessary support.
Disaster Alert Redirect:

For an enhanced experience, users can be redirected to a Disaster Alert website, providing real-time notifications and updates on ongoing natural disasters. This feature ensures that users are always informed and prepared.
Geolocation Feature:

Rescue Ready includes a geolocation feature that displays the user's current latitude and longitude on the home screen. This functionality aims to improve user awareness of their location during emergencies. While we initially planned to use this feature to send location data to volunteers in the vicinity, technical challenges prevented us from implementing this capability.
